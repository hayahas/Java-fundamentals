# Linter Documentation

In Linter Application, it reads the gates.js file and tracks it's lines 
it checks the semicolons of every line except lines with if and else statments bc
semicolons ends the if statment and thats wrong thats why any other line without if-else statments
should have a semicoln else an error message will occuur to the developer.
So as a dev-user if your file had the necessarry semicolns you will get 0 errors,
else the lines with messing semicolns will be mentioned for you to fix.
